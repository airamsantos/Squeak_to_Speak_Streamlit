        st.markdown('''***Squeak to Speak*** was created with a deep commitment to addressing the silent struggles many face when it comes to mental health. For too long, seeking support has been overshadowed by stigma, uncertainty, and barriers that make accessing the right help feel overwhelming. From the initial hesitation to share emotions to the daunting process of finding a suitable therapist, countless individuals remain trapped in a cycle of avoidance and worsening conditions.      
                    The inspiration for ***Squeak to Speak*** emerged from personal experiences and the stories of others, highlighting a pressing need for a solution that bridges the gap between emotional needs and accessible support. Leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), we envisioned a tool that could offer understanding, empathy, and guidance.      
                    To close this gap, we built ***Squeaky***, an AI assistant designed to provide more than just temporary relief. ***Squeaky*** empowers users with personalized coping strategies and, when the time is right, connects them with professional help—all while respecting their unique pace, preferences, and financial circumstances.''')
